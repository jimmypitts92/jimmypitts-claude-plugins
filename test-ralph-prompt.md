# Test Ralph Loop - Simple Counter

Your task is to create and increment a counter file.

## Steps:

1. Check if `ralph-test-counter.txt` exists
2. If it doesn't exist, create it with content: `0`
3. If it exists, read the current number, add 1, and write the new number
4. Display the current count

## Completion:

When the counter reaches 3, output: `<promise>DONE</promise>`

That's it! Each iteration should increment the counter.
